        <h2>hi, i'm lupe! ✨</h2>
        <p class="lede">i'm lupe (lupita en español). i study IT + web dev and collect hobbies the way other people
          collect keychains.</p>

        <h3>early days</h3>
        <p>tiny backyard gardens, dial-up internet, and a camcorder that ate tapes — that's where i learned to tinker…
        </p>

        <h3>why tech</h3>
        <p>i like puzzles. code is just puzzles that talk back. i'm learning front-end first, then security basics and
          python.</p>

        <h3>things i make</h3>
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>little websites and shiny CSS experiments</li>
          <li>handmade stuff: embroidery, clay, and chaotic kid crafts</li>
          <li>photos and notes from my “tiny garden” project</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>now</h3>
        <p>balancing school, two kiddos, and a brain that thrives on projects. this site is my scrapbook of learning and
          trying.</p>

        <h2>my story</h2>
        <p><em>content note:</em> mentions of past substance use and a past suicide attempt.</p>

        <details class="expand">
          <summary>full story</summary>
          <p>after high school i didn't really have a clear path. in 2019 i went through a rough patch with my mental
            health and ended up hospitalized. that experience pushed me to finally get into therapy and psych care, and
            i've been slowly figuring myself out since then.</p>

          <p>for a while i worked nights as a caregiver for two nonverbal men with autism. that job really shaped me. it
            taught me patience and showed me how unfair the world can be to people with disabilities. it's something
            i'll always care about and advocate for.</p>

          <p>becoming a mom changed everything. i had my son when i was 21 and then my daughter in 2022. i stepped away
            from caregiving when i realized i couldn't give it my whole self anymore. after that i tried warehouse work
            for a bit. i learned a lot about people and the trucking world, but i knew i wanted something different.</p>

          <p>that's when i leaned into tech. i joined climb hire, started working on my compTIA a+ (core 1 down,
            planning to finish certification soon), and now i'm studying IT and web development in college. it’s a new
            direction, but it feels right.</p>

          <p>these days i'm focused on taking care of my kids, keeping up with school, and building something more
            stable for us.</p>
