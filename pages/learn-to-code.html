                <h2>what is a network?</h2>
                <p>
                    a network can be very small, like two computers connected by a cable in a home
                    setup, or extremely large, like the internet, which connects devices all over
                    the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    networks can include things like phones, personal computers, servers, printers,
                    security systems, and even wearable devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    these devices communicate using different types of connections, such as wired
                    cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    this section focuses on the basics of how networks work and how technicians
                    support and maintain them.
                </p>

                <h2>network models</h2>
                <p>
                    in networking, a topology is a way of describing how a network is organized and
                    how its parts relate to each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    to really understand a network, you need to look at it in two different ways:
                    how it physically exists, and how it logically operates.
                </p>

                <h3>physical topology</h3>
                <p>
                    physical topology refers to the tangible parts of a network. this includes
                    computers, switches, routers, and the cables or wireless signals that connect
                    them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    it's what you would see if you could lay the entire network out in front of you
                    in our real world.
                </p>

                <h3>logical topology</h3>
                <p>
                    logical topology focuses on how the network functions rather than how it looks.
                    it describes how software controls connections, manages access, and allows data
                    to move between devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    this includes how users and applications gain access to the network and how
                    resources like programs and data are shared.
                </p>

                <p class="tip">
                    if physical topology is the visible world of devices and cables, logical topology
                    is the unseen layer. the “wired” space where information flows. basically, this
                    is where <em>lain</em> exists ( ´ ꒳ ` ) ♡
                </p>

                <p>
                    this part introduces network models, which help explain how computers relate to
                    each other on a network and how access to resources is managed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    later on, physical components and physical topologies are covered, but for now
                    the focus is on how networks function at the software and operating system level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    controlling who can access network resources is handled by the operating systems
                    used on the network. the operating system determines how users and programs
                    connect and interact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    most networks follow one of two models: peer-to-peer or client-server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    a peer-to-peer model allows devices like desktops, laptops, tablets, or phones
                    to share resources directly with each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    the client-server model relies on a dedicated system that manages access for the
                    entire network. this typically requires a network operating system that controls
                    users, permissions, and shared resources.

                <h2>peer-to-peer network model</h2>
                <p>
                    in a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, each computer is responsible for managing access
                    to its own resources. there is no central system controlling the network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    the computers on the network (often called nodes or hosts) form a group that
                    shares resources directly with one another. each device handles its own users,
                    security settings, and shared files.
                </p>

                <p>
                    p2p networks can use many common operating systems, such as windows, linux, macos,
                    or chrome os on desktops and laptops, and ios or android on mobile devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    devices in a p2p network share resources using built-in file sharing features or
                    user accounts. many operating systems can share files with other devices even if
                    they are running different operating systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    in some setups, each computer keeps its own list of users and permissions. access
                    to files and folders is based on these local settings, which can become difficult
                    to manage as the network grows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    p2p networks are generally best for small environments, usually fewer than about
                    15 computers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    in a client-server network, access to shared resources is controlled by a central
                    system rather than by individual computers.

                    because servers must handle requests from many clients at the same time, they

                    this section focuses on common network services that are typically present on
                    most networks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    network services usually involve at least two endpoint devices. one device
                    requests data or a service, and another device provides it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    the requesting device is known as the client, while the device supplying the
                    resource or service is the server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    for example, when someone uses a web browser to load a webpage, the browser sends
                    a request to a web server, which responds by sending the requested data back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    the client and server do not need to be on the same local network. they can
                    communicate across multiple connected networks, such as through the internet.
                </p>

                <p class="tip">
                    web browsing is a basic example of a client requesting a service from a server,
                    even when they're far apart.
                </p>

                <h2>network protocols</h2>
                <p>
                    devices communicate using shared rules called
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="a protocol is a set of agreed-upon rules that devices follow so they know how to communicate with each other. it defines how messages are sent, received, and understood on a network."
                        tabindex="0">protocols</span>.
                    these rules define how data is requested, sent, and understood.
                </p>

                <p class="tip">
                    think of it like speaking german to someone who only speaks vietnamese. both languages are real
                    languages, but
                    without a shared language, nothing makes sense.
                </p>

                <p>
                    most modern networks rely on the
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="transmission control protocol and internet protocol:
tcp/ip is a collection of communication rules that networks use to send data across the internet. it provides the basic structure for how data is addressed, sent, and received between devices. many other protocols, like udp, are built on top of it."
                        tabindex="0">tcp/ip</span>
                    protocol suite to support communication across local networks and the internet.
                </p>

                <p class="tip">
                    you can think of tcp/ip as the common language the internet agrees on. without it, devices wouldn't
                    know how to send or receive information.
                </p>

                <h3>web services</h3>
                <p>
                    web traffic typically uses
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="hypertext transfer protocol. http is an application-layer protocol used on the web. it defines how web browsers request information from web servers and how servers respond by sending web pages and content."
                        tabindex="0">http</span>.
                    when encryption is added, the protocol becomes
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="https is a secure version of http. it encrypts data sent between a browser and a web server so information cannot be easily read or changed while it is being transmitted. https uses encryption provided by tls (and older systems used ssl)."
                        tabindex="0">https</span>
                    (http secure)
                </p>

                <p class="tip">
                    the application layer is the part of networking that users actually interact with. if you can see
                    it, click it, type into it, or read it, like loading a website, sending an email, or downloading a
                    file, it lives here. lower layers handle things like cables, signals, and data delivery. the
                    application layer focuses on what the user is trying to do.
                </p>


                <p>
                    secure web communication relies on encryption protocols such as
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="secure sockets layer. ssl was an early encryption method used to secure data sent over networks. it encrypted information between a client and server, but it is no longer considered secure and has been replaced by TLS. "
                        tabindex="0">ssl</span>
                    and
                    <span class="term"
                        data-def="transport layer security. tls is the modern and secure encryption protocol used to protect data sent between clients and servers. it performs the same role as ssl but with stronger security and improvements."
                        tabindex="0">tls</span>
                </p>

                    useful tool for web developers, especially when you're making lists. it can even double as your

                <p>by default, browsers will put a solid round dot in front of each list item.</p>
