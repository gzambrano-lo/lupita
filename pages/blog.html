        <p>
          hey, you found my blog! ✨ a mix of college struggles, mom life, and everyday
          chaos. nothing fancy, just me putting my thoughts somewhere they can
          breathe. think of it like a diary i left open on the kitchen table.

          <p>
            i built <strong>tinywebpractice</strong> as a quiet little site! soft colors, glassy cards,
            and space to think, but i wanted it to be more than just a static diary.
          </p>

          <p>
            behind the scenes, it's a real tiny full-stack project. the frontend is plain
            html, css, and js hosted on github pages. the backend is a cloudflare worker
            with a d1 database handling posts.
          </p>

          <p>
            instead of committing a new file every time i write, i made a private admin page.
            when i post, it sends a request to the worker, checks an admin key, and saves the entry
            remotely. the blog page just fetches and renders them.
          </p>

          <p>
            i like this setup because it keeps the site fast and simple, but gives me freedom.
            no cms, no framework, no heavy tooling... just small pieces i understand end-to-end.
          </p>

            <h2>restarting zoloft and absolutely wrecking my stomach</h2>
            <p class="meta">
              <time datetime="2025-12-24">posted december 24, 2025</time>
            </p>
          </header>

          <p>
            this week i decided to start taking my meds again. which, objectively, is a good step in my mental health
            journey.
            subjectively? i did it in the dumbest way possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            i take <strong>200mg of zoloft</strong>. i had stopped taking it for a while (classic “i'm fine actually”
            behavior)
            and instead of talking to my psychiatrist like a responsible adult, i just… started again. at my full dose.
            cold
            turkey back in. do <strong>not</strong> do that.
          </p>

          <p>
            when i tell you the nausea was unreal, i mean <em>unreal</em>. my stomach felt like it was trying to eject
            itself
            from my body. on the 22nd i literally did not eat anything at all because even the thought of food made me
            feel
            sick. not “oh i feel a little off,” but “if i move too fast i might throw up.”
          </p>

          <p>
            yesterday my stomach finally felt okay enough to eat, but now my brain feels like mashed potatoes. i feel
            slow.
            my thoughts are slow. my body feels heavy. everything takes effort. and the depression has rolled in like a
            ton of
            bricks.
          </p>

          <p>
            which is almost funny, because i've been in denial about being depressed while sleeping 14+ hours a day and
            struggling to wake up. at some point you have to laugh at yourself a little.
          </p>

          <p>
            so yeah. if you're on zoloft (or any ssri), stop taking it, and then decide to start again like i did:
            <strong>talk to a doctor first</strong>. restarting at a high dose can absolutely destroy your stomach and
            mess
            with your head. titration exists for a reason. i learned that the hard way.
          </p>

          <p>
            i don't regret getting back on my meds. i <em>do</em> regret doing it alone and pretending it would all be
            okay. lesson learned. next step is actually looping my doctor in instead of raw-dogging psych meds
            and
            acting surprised when my body revolts.
          </p>

          <p>
            if you're going through something similar: you're not broken, you're not weak, and you're definitely not
            alone.
            but please! learn from my mistake and get guidance before restarting. your stomach (and brain) will thank
            you.
          </p>

          <p>my world is small. the people i talk to are the only ones i've really got, so feeling overlooked cut deeper
            than i wanted to admit. with my sensitivity already on high and life being heavy, i just don't have the
            capacity for friendships right now.</p>

            an octopus with a mullet, a shotgun, a porch that's seen 17 divorces, pastel chaos, and a trucker hat that
            says “i don't netflix &amp; chill, i vhs and fuck.” i love squidbillies, so when this popped up in the
            “weird art for weird people” facebook group, it hijacked my whole brain.

          <p>sometimes i feel like i was born without a layer the world expects you to have.</p>
          <p>like everyone else learned how to keep a little distance between their hearts and the things that happen,
            and i just… didn't and everything cuts through.
            a tone shift. silence where warmth used to be. the kind that makes my jaw tighten before my mind can catch
            up. and i have to try and hold my face still to keep it from showing what my heart already knows and my body
            always wins anyways
          </p>
          <p>
            people say i care too much and they say it like its a flaw, but i dont know how else to be. when i love
            someone
            i memorize the way they breathe and their pauses and their rythm of their laugh and i hold them in my
            thoughts
            like something fragile and something that deserves respect and to be cherished
          </p>
          <p>
            but some people take your heart like its a paper cup
          </p>
          <p>
            and still like an idiot i tell myself dont be like them, keep trying, be soft, dont let them make you rough
            and think, think. even when my hands shake, i keep offering anyway, because it feels worse to withold love
            than to risk breaking again
          </p>
          <p>
            but if im being honest i sometimes wish i could build a thicker skin, something that doesnt wilt under
            coldness idk but maybe thats not my purpose here and sometimes i think i should be grateful for that. for
            still being able to feel <em>anything</em> ive known the dullness too and that quiet disgusting and cold
            grey feeling where joy feels like its behind glass
          </p>
          <p>
            even when it hurts i try to remind myself these aches just mean im alive and some days i can feel that truth
            other days i just dont lmao but i guess thats part of it too, the ebb, the flow. or whatever

            i didn't really have much planned today and was in kind of a sour mood, but ended up babysitting since my
            sister and her husband went out and my mom was headed to the rodeo. i was gifted an arrowhead plant (already
            propagated, so sweet), and before leaving my mom asked me to do her eyelash extensions. while i worked on
            them, i joked about my failed dreams of being an aesthetician and told her about the grant i once won but
            never used because i felt discouraged by her. she actually apologized, saying she didn't know what she was
            thinking back then — even said, “you should've done that right after high school.”

            later my brother-in-law gave me money to take the kids to chuck e. cheese. it was fun, surprisingly laid
            back
            and easy — honestly feels more designed for adults these days, with spirits and tap beer on the menu. the
            kids
            had a blast, and i got a moment of calm in the middle of everything. the day ended rough with an argument,
            but
            i don't feel like spilling all that here.

          <p>
            <strong>what is international day of indigenous women?</strong>
            every year, on september 5, international day of indigenous women is observed
            in honor of Bartolina Sisa, an Aymara warrior and leader from the 1700's
            who resisted colonial oppression in Peru alongside her husband Tupac Katari.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>who is natalia lizeth lópez lópez?</strong>
            in 2013, at only 11 years old, Natalia Lizeth López López from Veracruz, MX, delivered
            a speech that quickly spread accross the country. speaking during the children
            and youth parliament, she took the mic to address the struggles of indigenous ppl in mexico.
            her words were clear, unapologetic, and powerful. she called out inequality and urged for
            dignity and respect for ingenous communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>her voice still matters today</strong>
            indigenous women's day (sep 5) honors the voices, struggles, and leadership of women like
            bartolina sisa. natalia's voice (though she was a child) belongs in that same lineage of truth
            tellers. her courage is a reminder that indigenous women and girls continue to be at the forefront
            of defending culture, justice, and community.

            <p><strong>natalia lizeth lópez lópez's speech (2013, nuevo león, mexico)</strong></p>

            <p>
              good morning to everyone present. my name is Natalia Lizeth López López, I am a student at
              Professor Rodolfo de León Garza elementary school and i am proudly of <strong>Indigenous origin.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              i am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this photography contest "a citizen snapshot"
              organized
              by the electoral commision of nuevo leon. the theme being discussed today is very important. i feel that
              it belongs to me personally.
            </p>

            <p>
              we live in a megadiverse country. so many cultures mix their traiditions and customs in unique ways that
              make
              mexico a very special and unique country. mexico is one of the nations in the world with the greatest
              diversity of indigenous peoples.
            </p>

            <p>
              i don't know who chose the topic of this contest... 'multiculturalism in the state of nuevo leon' -- but i
              thank
              them enormously, because it opens a door to share somethig of our cultures with more people.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>my roots are indigenous.</strong> i belong to one of those cultures that are often treated as a
              minority in society. i belong to "las Marías", as we are called in the streets, pointing us out because of
              our
              clothes or for speaking an ancient language: Náhuatl. and even though i live in the big city of Nuevo
              León,
              my parents make sure i learn the value of our roots in Veracruz.
            </p>

            <p>
              i was born near the cerro del viento. where they say the hand of Moctezuma is imprinted on the rock. a
              huge
              silhouette, a beautiful sight.
            </p>

            <p>
              even at my young age, helping my parents work with their work as street vendors has given me the chance to
              see
              many different realities of life. my mom sells plants in the local markets. she tells her clients: "give
              your plant water and treat it with love so that it blooms." and to me says "brush your teeth after every
              meal
              if you want them to stay white. put on lotion everyday so your skin wont dry out. read for 30 minutes a
              day
              and
              you'll learn many things."
            </p>

            <p>
              one day, my teacher wrote on the board: "a drop of water pierces the rock, not because of its strength but
              because of it's persistence." at first, i didn't understand. but when she gave examples, i thought of my
              parents
              and everything they tell me every day. now i understand that things are only achieved if we are
              consistent.
            </p>

            <p>
              i see on the news that crime, kidnappings, and corruption are rising, while education is failing. why do
              we
              lose respect
              for our elders, our neighbors, our country? why are the many indigenous groups in mexico dissapearing? why
              dont we
              value the richness of our roots?
            </p>

            <p>
              because we are not practicing <strong>values.</strong> everyday we stop doing deeds, stop caring for
              others.
              adults get lost in the stress of daily life and focus so much on material things that they forget
              what really matters: teaching love and values in the family.
            </p>

            <p>
              mexico needs a strong program to rescue values. we need to practice honesty, practice communication,
              practice tolerance, practice loyalty. practice, practice, practice values — many values — every day: at
              home, in school, at work, in the parks, in photography contests, everywhere and at all times.
            </p>

            <p>
              consistency would make adults more respectful, punctual, cordial, organized, and productive. this would
              increase progress in the workplace, which is the motor of the country. and if children practiced values,
              if
              single mothers, street children, people with disabilities, and all vulnerable groups practiced values,
              they
              would become more active, more productive, more motivated — and above all, <strong>happier.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              if cultural diversity were respected, if we recovered the values and respect practiced by our ancestors,
              our
              country would be so rich. if respect became a tradition, then presidential agreements, business with other
              countries, investments from big companies, and national programs would all be done with the well-being of
              people in mind, and honesty would prevail in every law.
            </p>

            <p>
              let us remember our indigenous ancestors. they didn't sign papers, because their word was enough. they
              were
              people of honor.
            </p>

            <p>
              why do we adopt foreign holidays like halloween and easter? why not fight to rescue our beautiful mexican
              traditions, so forgotten? let's live our own celebrations. let's spread and share the love for our many
              cultures that are disappearing.
            </p>

            <p>
              let's support equality, let's support the integration of indigenous peoples into society. let's value our
              traditional foods — pipián, bocoles, and zacahuil — it's such a shame that many people don't even know
              them,
              even though they are typical dishes of Mexico.
            </p>

            <p>
              this contest gives us the chance to celebrate the multiculturalism of our state. hopefully, the democracy
              of
              our country will be the same for all groups of people
            </p>

            <p>
              how beautiful it would be if indigenous communities had the chance to participate in the political life of
              the country.
            </p>

            <p>
              i am Natalia. I speak Náhuatl because my mother teaches me. but i feel sadness that i do not speak
              totonaca,
              the language my father carries in his heart.
            </p>

            <p>
              i am 100% proudly Indigenous. and although i have sometimes been humiliated or looked down upon, i am
              happy
              because i know i am part of the great roots of mexico. and of one thing i am sure: we need much more
              courage
              to rescue so much history, so many values, so many traditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              let's rescue our identity. let's build a mexico with today's technology, but guided by the values of
              yesterday. If each of us valued the good in our cultures, how rich our society would be!
            </p>

            <p>
              forget your cellphone, your video games, your chat for a little while — and hug the people you love. talk
              to
              them face to face, and the bonds of love and values will grow.
            </p>

            <p>
              let's respect cultural diversity. let's respect our society. let's build one culture: the culture of
              peace.
            </p>

            <p>
              thank you very much.

            i want to thank the person who recently signed my guestbook. your words came at the
            exact moment i needed them.
          </p>

          <p>
            i'd just gone thru something that hurt me more than i expected. kind of embarassing to admit but
            a gc thing left me feeling rejected in that old familiar way, like being a kid again trying to make
            friends and not fitting in
          </p>

          <p>
            i know i can be too much but tbh i thought i was in a space where that was okay??
          </p>

          <p>
            the past past two days, i was struggling to untangle my feelings from logic. ik in my head it wasnt abt
            me. either way, my heart still felt heavy
          </p>

          <p>
            it's silly, but i got pushed to the point of asking myself, why am i building and wasting my time on
            this stupid site. bc who am i trying to impress?
          </p>

          <p>
            rn im eating my current hyperfixation meal - turkey + jellied cranberry sauce + provolone on sourdough (its
            all warm and toasty ofc) while typing this out.
          </p>

          <p>
            ur message soothed me!! thank u so much. your words reminded me, that i DO belong and i'll carry that w me

          <p><strong><em>this is what humans wish they were</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>physical traits</strong></p>
          <p><strong>skin:</strong> semi transparent in places. showing faint outlines of veins and organs.
            <em><strong>ALWAYS </strong>moist.</em> coated in a thin biofilm
            of protective peptides (cerave could never)
          </p>

          <p><strong>eyes:</strong> large and gold green with a third eyelid that slides accross for protection. adapted
            to both both underwater
            and night vision
          </p>

          <p><strong>limbs:</strong> strong legs with spring loaded tendons. cap leap 20+ feet in a single bound.
            fingers tipped with suction like pads for climbing
          </p>

          <p><strong>posture:</strong> semi crouched stance. flexible-spine for both land and water movememnt
          </p>

          <p><strong>voice:</strong> a resonant, vibrato-like call that can shake the air. partly for communication,
            mostly for intimidation
          </p>

          <p><strong>biological upgrades</strong></p>
          <p><strong>pain immunity:</strong> they secrete dermorphin-like peptides that dull pain instantly. they
            can keep fighting or working through major injuries.</p>
          <p><strong>circulation control:</strong> they conciously expand or constrict blood vessels. can warm
            themselves
            in
            cold climates or cool down during stress. </p>
          <p><strong>visionary defense:</strong> when under extreme stress, their glands release 5-meO-dmt-like
            compounds
            into their bloodstream, forcing them into hyper awareness and prophetic hallunications. some cultures see
            the frog as an oracle.</p>
          <p><strong>tear weapon:</strong> when threatened, they cry bufotenin-laced tears. contact causes attackers to
            hallunicate or stumble.
          </p>

            it's the end of the quarter and instead of feeling accomplished i just feel drained.
            college is supposed to be exciting. but i've been struggling to balance everything in my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            between being a mom, keeping the house clean, cooking.. it feels like there's never
            enough of me to go around. the constant juggling makes it hard to give school the attention
            it deserves.
          </p>

          <p>
            things got even tougher with my kids getting sick at daycare again and again. hand foot and mouth
            with each visit. it's nearly impossible when there's whining, chaos, and the feeling that i've
            suddenly become their personal waiter.
          </p>

          <p>
            i know i'm not giving up, but right now i'm just tired. maybe writing this down will be my reminder
            that even if it feels messy im still pushing through ♡

            we found three little kittens hiding under our porch. today i bought them some kibble
            (for proper nutrition) and left it out for them. last night i even gave them a tube of old
            pâté from the fridge — not exactly ideal, but i wanted to help! i really hope they start
            to trust me soon. maybe enough to take treats straight from me one day. ♡

            i finally cooked up the new layout! split the CSS by tokens/base/layout/components
            and i'm proud of how clean it feels. nav pills got a tiny lift, cards feel snappier,
            and the media grid loads faster (hello 1200/900 square thumbs).
            next: polish the links page to match!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>updated fonts + spacing</li>
            <li>better card shadows + borders</li>
            <li>faster media thumbnails (1200/900 square) ♡</li>
          </ul>

            i wrote a longer “about me” lore post! probably going to link it from the media log too.
            sharing this with css155, stomach doing backflips lol. it's late but i'm proud.
            please roast (kindly)! what's confusing, slow, or ugly so i can fix it? ♡
