          hey, you found my blog! ‚ú® a mix of college struggles, mom life, and everyday
          chaos. nothing fancy, just me putting my thoughts somewhere they can
          breathe. think of it like a diary i left open on the kitchen table.

        <p><strong><em>this is what humans wish they were</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>physical traits</strong></p>
        <p><strong>skin:</strong> semi transparent in places. showing faint outlines of veins and organs.
          <em><strong>ALWAYS </strong>moist.</em> coated in a thin biofilm
          of protective peptides (cerave could never)
        </p>

        <p><strong>eyes:</strong> large and gold green with a third eyelid that slides accross for protection. adapted
          to both both underwater
          and night vision
        </p>

        <p><strong>limbs:</strong> strong legs with spring loaded tendons. cap leap 20+ feet in a single bound.
          fingers tipped with suction like pads for climbing
        </p>

        <p><strong>posture:</strong> semi crouched stance. flexible-spine for both land and water movememnt
        </p>

        <p><strong>voice:</strong> a resonant, vibrato-like call that can shake the air. partly for communication,
          mostly for intimidation
        </p>

        <p><strong>biological upgrades</strong></p>
        <p><strong>pain immunity:</strong> they secrete dermorphin-like peptides that dull pain instantly. they
          can keep fighting or working through major injuries.</p>
        <p><strong>circulation control:</strong> they conciously expand or constrict blood vessels. can warm themselves
          in
          cold climates or cool down during stress. </p>
        <p><strong>visionary defense:</strong> when under extreme stress, their glands release 5-meO-dmt-like compounds
          into their bloodstream, forcing them into hyper awareness and prophetic hallunications. some cultures see
          the frog as an oracle.</p>
        <p><strong>tear weapon:</strong> when threatened, they cry bufotenin-laced tears. contact causes attackers to
          hallunicate or stumble.
        </p>

        <p><strong>sources:</strong>this is just a 'amphidian' write up, a hybrid concept i made up but its inspired on
          real frog biology.

          it's the end of the quarter and instead of feeling accomplished i just feel drained.
          college is supposed to be exciting. but i've been struggling to balance everything in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          between being a mom, keeping the house clean, cooking.. it feels like there's never
          enough of me to go around. the constant juggling makes it hard to give school the attention
          it deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          things got even tougher with my kids getting sick at daycare again and again. hand foot and mouth
          with each visit. it's nearly impossible when there's whining, chaos, and the feeling that i've
          suddenly become their personal waiter.
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i'm not giving up, but right now i'm just tired. maybe writing this down will be my reminder
          that even if it feels messy im still pushing through ‚ô°

          we found three little kittens hiding under our porch. today i bought them some kibble
          (for proper nutrition) and left it out for them. last night i even gave them a tube of old
          p√¢t√© from the fridge ‚Äî not exactly ideal, but i wanted to help! i really hope they start
          to trust me soon. maybe enough to take treats straight from me one day. ‚ô°

          i finally cooked up the new layout! split the CSS by tokens/base/layout/components
          and i'm proud of how clean it feels. nav pills got a tiny lift, cards feel snappier,
          and the media grid loads faster (hello 1200/900 square thumbs).
          next: polish the links page to match!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>updated fonts + spacing</li>
          <li>better card shadows + borders</li>
          <li>faster media thumbnails (1200/900 square) ‚ô°</li>
        </ul>
