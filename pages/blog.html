        <p>
          hey, you found my blog! ✨ a mix of college struggles, mom life, and everyday
          chaos. nothing fancy, just me putting my thoughts somewhere they can
          breathe. think of it like a diary i left open on the kitchen table.

        <p><strong>physical traits</strong></p>
        <p><strong>skin:</strong> semi transparent in places. showing faint outlines of veins and organs.
          <em><strong>ALWAYS </strong>moist.</em> coated in a thin biofilm

          it's the end of the quarter and instead of feeling accomplished i just feel drained.
          college is supposed to be exciting. but i've been struggling to balance everything in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          between being a mom, keeping the house clean, cooking.. it feels like there's never
          enough of me to go around. the constant juggling makes it hard to give school the attention
          it deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          things got even tougher with my kids getting sick at daycare again and again. hand foot and mouth
          with each visit. it's nearly impossible when there's whining, chaos, and the feeling that i've
          suddenly become their personal waiter.
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i'm not giving up, but right now i'm just tired. maybe writing this down will be my reminder
          that even if it feels messy im still pushing through ♡

          we found three little kittens hiding under our porch. today i bought them some kibble
          (for proper nutrition) and left it out for them. last night i even gave them a tube of old
          pâté from the fridge — not exactly ideal, but i wanted to help! i really hope they start
          to trust me soon. maybe enough to take treats straight from me one day. ♡

          i finally cooked up the new layout! split the CSS by tokens/base/layout/components
          and i'm proud of how clean it feels. nav pills got a tiny lift, cards feel snappier,
          and the media grid loads faster (hello 1200/900 square thumbs).
          next: polish the links page to match!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>updated fonts + spacing</li>
          <li>better card shadows + borders</li>
          <li>faster media thumbnails (1200/900 square) ♡</li>
        </ul>

          i wrote a longer “about me” lore post! probably going to link it from the media log too.
          sharing this with css155, stomach doing backflips lol. it's late but i'm proud.
          please roast (kindly)! what's confusing, slow, or ugly so i can fix it? ♡
