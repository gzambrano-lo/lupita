        <p>
          hey, you found my blog! ✨ a mix of college struggles, mom life, and everyday
          chaos. nothing fancy, just me putting my thoughts somewhere they can
          breathe. think of it like a diary i left open on the kitchen table.

          <h2>international day of indigenous women | dia de las mujeres indigenas</h2>
          <p class="meta"><time datetime="2025-09-05">posted sep 5, 2025</time></p>

        <p>
          <strong>what is international day of indigenous women?</strong>
          every year, on september 5, international day of indigenous women is observed
          in honor of Bartolina Sisa, an Aymara warrior and leader from the 1700's
          who resisted colonial oppression in Peru alongside her husband Tupac Katari.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>who is natalia lizeth lópez lópez?</strong>
          in 2013, at only 11 years old, Natalia Lizeth López López from Veracruz, MX, delivered
          a speech that quickly spread accross the country. speaking during the children
          and youth parliament, she took the mic to address the struggles of indigenous ppl in mexico.
          her words were clear, unapologetic, and powerful. she called out inequality and urged for
          dignity and respect for ingenous communities.
        </p>

        <!--natalias speech-->

        <p>
          <strong>her voice still matters today</strong>
          indigenous women's day (sep 5) honors the voices, struggles, and leadership of women like
          bartolina sisa. natalia's voice (though she was a child) belongs in that same lineage of truth
          tellers. her courage is a reminder that indigenous women and girls continue to be at the forefront
          of defending culture, justice, and community.

          i want to thank the person who recently signed my guestbook. your words came at the
          exact moment i needed them.
        </p>

        <p>
          i'd just gone thru something that hurt me more than i expected. kind of embarassing to admit but
          a gc thing left me feeling rejected in that old familiar way, like being a kid again trying to make
          friends and not fitting in
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i can be too much but tbh i thought i was in a space where that was okay??
        </p>

        <p>
          the past past two days, i was struggling to untangle my feelings from logic. ik in my head it wasnt abt
          me. either way, my heart still felt heavy
        </p>

        <p>
          it's silly, but i got pushed to the point of asking myself, why am i building and wasting my time on
          this stupid site. bc who am i trying to impress?
        </p>

        <p>
          rn im eating my current hyperfixation meal - turkey + jellied cranberry sauce + provolone on sourdough (its
          all warm and toasty ofc) while typing this out.
        </p>

        <p>
          ur message soothed me!! thank u so much. your words reminded me, that i DO belong and i'll carry that w me

          it's the end of the quarter and instead of feeling accomplished i just feel drained.
          college is supposed to be exciting. but i've been struggling to balance everything in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          between being a mom, keeping the house clean, cooking.. it feels like there's never
          enough of me to go around. the constant juggling makes it hard to give school the attention
          it deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          things got even tougher with my kids getting sick at daycare again and again. hand foot and mouth
          with each visit. it's nearly impossible when there's whining, chaos, and the feeling that i've
          suddenly become their personal waiter.
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i'm not giving up, but right now i'm just tired. maybe writing this down will be my reminder
          that even if it feels messy im still pushing through ♡

          we found three little kittens hiding under our porch. today i bought them some kibble
          (for proper nutrition) and left it out for them. last night i even gave them a tube of old
          pâté from the fridge — not exactly ideal, but i wanted to help! i really hope they start
          to trust me soon. maybe enough to take treats straight from me one day. ♡

          i finally cooked up the new layout! split the CSS by tokens/base/layout/components
          and i'm proud of how clean it feels. nav pills got a tiny lift, cards feel snappier,
          and the media grid loads faster (hello 1200/900 square thumbs).
          next: polish the links page to match!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>updated fonts + spacing</li>
          <li>better card shadows + borders</li>
          <li>faster media thumbnails (1200/900 square) ♡</li>
