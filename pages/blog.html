        <p>
          hey, you found my blog! ‚ú® a mix of college struggles, mom life, and everyday
          chaos. nothing fancy, just me putting my thoughts somewhere they can
          breathe. think of it like a diary i left open on the kitchen table.

          i didn't really have much planned today and was in kind of a sour mood, but ended up babysitting since my
          sister and her husband went out and my mom was headed to the rodeo. i was gifted an arrowhead plant (already
          propagated, so sweet), and before leaving my mom asked me to do her eyelash extensions. while i worked on
          them, i joked about my failed dreams of being an aesthetician and told her about the grant i once won but
          never used because i felt discouraged by her. she actually apologized, saying she didn't know what she was
          thinking back then ‚Äî even said, ‚Äúyou should've done that right after high school.‚Äù

          later my brother-in-law gave me money to take the kids to chuck e. cheese. it was fun, surprisingly laid back
          and easy ‚Äî honestly feels more designed for adults these days, with spirits and tap beer on the menu. the kids
          had a blast, and i got a moment of calm in the middle of everything. the day ended rough with an argument, but
          i don't feel like spilling all that here.

        <p>
          <strong>what is international day of indigenous women?</strong>
          every year, on september 5, international day of indigenous women is observed
          in honor of Bartolina Sisa, an Aymara warrior and leader from the 1700's
          who resisted colonial oppression in Peru alongside her husband Tupac Katari.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>who is natalia lizeth l√≥pez l√≥pez?</strong>
          in 2013, at only 11 years old, Natalia Lizeth L√≥pez L√≥pez from Veracruz, MX, delivered
          a speech that quickly spread accross the country. speaking during the children
          and youth parliament, she took the mic to address the struggles of indigenous ppl in mexico.
          her words were clear, unapologetic, and powerful. she called out inequality and urged for
          dignity and respect for ingenous communities.
        </p>

          <strong>her voice still matters today</strong>
          indigenous women's day (sep 5) honors the voices, struggles, and leadership of women like
          bartolina sisa. natalia's voice (though she was a child) belongs in that same lineage of truth
          tellers. her courage is a reminder that indigenous women and girls continue to be at the forefront
          of defending culture, justice, and community.

          <p><strong>natalia lizeth l√≥pez l√≥pez's speech (2013, nuevo le√≥n, mexico)</strong></p>

          <p>
            good morning to everyone present. my name is Natalia Lizeth L√≥pez L√≥pez, I am a student at
            Professor Rodolfo de Le√≥n Garza elementary school and i am proudly of <strong>Indigenous origin.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            i am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this photography contest "a citizen snapshot" organized
            by the electoral commision of nuevo leon. the theme being discussed today is very important. i feel that
            it belongs to me personally.
          </p>

          <p>
            we live in a megadiverse country. so many cultures mix their traiditions and customs in unique ways that
            make
            mexico a very special and unique country. mexico is one of the nations in the world with the greatest
            diversity of indigenous peoples.
          </p>

          <p>
            i don't know who chose the topic of this contest... 'multiculturalism in the state of nuevo leon' -- but i
            thank
            them enormously, because it opens a door to share somethig of our cultures with more people.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>my roots are indigenous.</strong> i belong to one of those cultures that are often treated as a
            minority in society. i belong to "las Mar√≠as", as we are called in the streets, pointing us out because of
            our
            clothes or for speaking an ancient language: N√°huatl. and even though i live in the big city of Nuevo Le√≥n,
            my parents make sure i learn the value of our roots in Veracruz.
          </p>

          <p>
            i was born near the cerro del viento. where they say the hand of Moctezuma is imprinted on the rock. a huge
            silhouette, a beautiful sight.
          </p>

          <p>
            even at my young age, helping my parents work with their work as street vendors has given me the chance to
            see
            many different realities of life. my mom sells plants in the local markets. she tells her clients: "give
            your plant water and treat it with love so that it blooms." and to me says "brush your teeth after every
            meal
            if you want them to stay white. put on lotion everyday so your skin wont dry out. read for 30 minutes a day
            and
            you'll learn many things."
          </p>

          <p>
            one day, my teacher wrote on the board: "a drop of water pierces the rock, not because of its strength but
            because of it's persistence." at first, i didn't understand. but when she gave examples, i thought of my
            parents
            and everything they tell me every day. now i understand that things are only achieved if we are consistent.
          </p>

          <p>
            i see on the news that crime, kidnappings, and corruption are rising, while education is failing. why do we
            lose respect
            for our elders, our neighbors, our country? why are the many indigenous groups in mexico dissapearing? why
            dont we
            value the richness of our roots?
          </p>

          <p>
            because we are not practicing <strong>values.</strong> everyday we stop doing deeds, stop caring for others.
            adults get lost in the stress of daily life and focus so much on material things that they forget
            what really matters: teaching love and values in the family.
          </p>

          <p>
            mexico needs a strong program to rescue values. we need to practice honesty, practice communication,
            practice tolerance, practice loyalty. practice, practice, practice values ‚Äî many values ‚Äî every day: at
            home, in school, at work, in the parks, in photography contests, everywhere and at all times.
          </p>

          <p>
            consistency would make adults more respectful, punctual, cordial, organized, and productive. this would
            increase progress in the workplace, which is the motor of the country. and if children practiced values, if
            single mothers, street children, people with disabilities, and all vulnerable groups practiced values, they
            would become more active, more productive, more motivated ‚Äî and above all, <strong>happier.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            if cultural diversity were respected, if we recovered the values and respect practiced by our ancestors, our
            country would be so rich. if respect became a tradition, then presidential agreements, business with other
            countries, investments from big companies, and national programs would all be done with the well-being of
            people in mind, and honesty would prevail in every law.
          </p>

          <p>
            let us remember our indigenous ancestors. they didn't sign papers, because their word was enough. they were
            people of honor.
          </p>

          <p>
            why do we adopt foreign holidays like halloween and easter? why not fight to rescue our beautiful mexican
            traditions, so forgotten? let's live our own celebrations. let's spread and share the love for our many
            cultures that are disappearing.
          </p>

          <p>
            let's support equality, let's support the integration of indigenous peoples into society. let's value our
            traditional foods ‚Äî pipi√°n, bocoles, and zacahuil ‚Äî it's such a shame that many people don't even know them,
            even though they are typical dishes of Mexico.
          </p>

          <p>
            this contest gives us the chance to celebrate the multiculturalism of our state. hopefully, the democracy of
            our country will be the same for all groups of people
          </p>

          <p>
            how beautiful it would be if indigenous communities had the chance to participate in the political life of
            the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            i am Natalia. I speak N√°huatl because my mother teaches me. but i feel sadness that i do not speak totonaca,
            the language my father carries in his heart.
          </p>

          <p>
            i am 100% proudly Indigenous. and although i have sometimes been humiliated or looked down upon, i am happy
            because i know i am part of the great roots of mexico. and of one thing i am sure: we need much more courage
            to rescue so much history, so many values, so many traditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            let's rescue our identity. let's build a mexico with today's technology, but guided by the values of
            yesterday. If each of us valued the good in our cultures, how rich our society would be!
          </p>

          <p>
            forget your cellphone, your video games, your chat for a little while ‚Äî and hug the people you love. talk to
            them face to face, and the bonds of love and values will grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            let's respect cultural diversity. let's respect our society. let's build one culture: the culture of peace.
          </p>

          <p>
            thank you very much.

          i want to thank the person who recently signed my guestbook. your words came at the
          exact moment i needed them.
        </p>

        <p>
          i'd just gone thru something that hurt me more than i expected. kind of embarassing to admit but
          a gc thing left me feeling rejected in that old familiar way, like being a kid again trying to make
          friends and not fitting in
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i can be too much but tbh i thought i was in a space where that was okay??
        </p>

        <p>
          the past past two days, i was struggling to untangle my feelings from logic. ik in my head it wasnt abt
          me. either way, my heart still felt heavy
        </p>

        <p>
          it's silly, but i got pushed to the point of asking myself, why am i building and wasting my time on
          this stupid site. bc who am i trying to impress?
        </p>

        <p>
          rn im eating my current hyperfixation meal - turkey + jellied cranberry sauce + provolone on sourdough (its
          all warm and toasty ofc) while typing this out.
        </p>

        <p>
          ur message soothed me!! thank u so much. your words reminded me, that i DO belong and i'll carry that w me

        <p><strong>physical traits</strong></p>
        <p><strong>skin:</strong> semi transparent in places. showing faint outlines of veins and organs.
          <em><strong>ALWAYS </strong>moist.</em> coated in a thin biofilm
          of protective peptides (cerave could never)
        </p>

        <p><strong>eyes:</strong> large and gold green with a third eyelid that slides accross for protection. adapted
          to both both underwater
          and night vision
        </p>

        <p><strong>limbs:</strong> strong legs with spring loaded tendons. cap leap 20+ feet in a single bound.
          fingers tipped with suction like pads for climbing
        </p>

        <p><strong>posture:</strong> semi crouched stance. flexible-spine for both land and water movememnt
        </p>

        <p><strong>voice:</strong> a resonant, vibrato-like call that can shake the air. partly for communication,
          mostly for intimidation
        </p>

        <p><strong>biological upgrades</strong></p>
        <p><strong>pain immunity:</strong> they secrete dermorphin-like peptides that dull pain instantly. they
          can keep fighting or working through major injuries.</p>
        <p><strong>circulation control:</strong> they conciously expand or constrict blood vessels. can warm themselves
          in
          cold climates or cool down during stress. </p>
        <p><strong>visionary defense:</strong> when under extreme stress, their glands release 5-meO-dmt-like compounds
          into their bloodstream, forcing them into hyper awareness and prophetic hallunications. some cultures see
          the frog as an oracle.</p>
        <p><strong>tear weapon:</strong> when threatened, they cry bufotenin-laced tears. contact causes attackers to
          hallunicate or stumble.

          it's the end of the quarter and instead of feeling accomplished i just feel drained.
          college is supposed to be exciting. but i've been struggling to balance everything in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          between being a mom, keeping the house clean, cooking.. it feels like there's never
          enough of me to go around. the constant juggling makes it hard to give school the attention
          it deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          things got even tougher with my kids getting sick at daycare again and again. hand foot and mouth
          with each visit. it's nearly impossible when there's whining, chaos, and the feeling that i've
          suddenly become their personal waiter.
        </p>

        <p>
          i know i'm not giving up, but right now i'm just tired. maybe writing this down will be my reminder
          that even if it feels messy im still pushing through ‚ô°

          we found three little kittens hiding under our porch. today i bought them some kibble
          (for proper nutrition) and left it out for them. last night i even gave them a tube of old
          p√¢t√© from the fridge ‚Äî not exactly ideal, but i wanted to help! i really hope they start
          to trust me soon. maybe enough to take treats straight from me one day. ‚ô°

          i finally cooked up the new layout! split the CSS by tokens/base/layout/components
          and i'm proud of how clean it feels. nav pills got a tiny lift, cards feel snappier,
          and the media grid loads faster (hello 1200/900 square thumbs).
          next: polish the links page to match!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>updated fonts + spacing</li>
          <li>better card shadows + borders</li>
          <li>faster media thumbnails (1200/900 square) ‚ô°</li>
        </ul>

          please roast (kindly)! what's confusing, slow, or ugly so i can fix it? ‚ô°
