                <p>
                    this week i decided to start taking my meds again. which, objectively, is a good step in my mental
                    health
                    journey. subjectively? i did it in the dumbest way possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i take <strong>200mg of zoloft</strong>. i had stopped taking it for a while (classic “i’m fine
                    actually”
                    behavior) and instead of talking to my psychiatrist like a responsible adult, i just… started again.
                    at my
                    full dose. cold turkey back in. do <strong>not</strong> do that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    when i tell you the nausea was unreal, i mean <em>unreal</em>. my stomach felt like it was trying to
                    eject
                    itself from my body. on december 22 i didn’t eat anything at all because even the thought of food
                    made me feel
                    sick. not “oh i feel a little off,” but “if i move too fast i might throw up.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    yesterday my stomach finally felt okay enough to eat, but my brain feels like mashed potatoes. i
                    feel slow.
                    my thoughts are slow. my body feels heavy. everything takes effort. and the depression hit like a
                    ton of
                    bricks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    which is almost funny, because i've been in denial about being depressed while sleeping 14+ hours a
                    day and
                    struggling to wake up. at some point you have to laugh at yourself a little.
                </p>

                <p>
                    so yeah. if you're on zoloft (or any ssri), stop taking it, and then decide to start again like i
                    did:
                    <strong>talk to a doctor first</strong>. restarting at a high dose can absolutely wreck your stomach
                    and mess
                    with your head. titration exists for a reason. i learned that the hard way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i don't regret getting back on my meds. i <em>do</em> regret doing it alone and pretending it would
                    all be okay. lesson learned. next step is actually looping my doctor in instead of raw-dogging psych
                    meds
                    and acting surprised when my body revolts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    if you're going through something similar: you're not broken, you're not weak, and you're definitely
                    not
                    alone. but please! learn from my mistake and get guidance before restarting. your stomach (and
                    brain) will
                    thank you.
                </p>
